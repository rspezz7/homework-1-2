    <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
    <p>
        I am a third year computer science and mathematics student at Northeastern University. I'm from Reading, Massachusetts, which is about a half hour north of Boston. I've done gymnastics my whole life and I'm on the gymnastics team at school currently. I have a younger sister and a cat named Gilligan. Click on his photo to see more of him!

    <img src="images/gilligan.jpg" alt="Gilligan: An image of my pet cat, Gilligan." width=100px/>
    <img src="images/gymnastics.webp" alt="An image of me doing gymnastics in high school." width=300px/>
    <p>In the future, I'd like to include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A video of me doing gymnastics</li>
        <li>A map of my hometown</li>
        <li>An audio clip of Gilligan meowing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On my website.</p>
